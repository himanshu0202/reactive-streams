# reactive-streams
 Full Reactive Stack with Angular, Sprint Boot 2, and Spring WebFlux
 
 This project uses Angular to create a frontend for viewing quotes fetched from the backend both in a Blocking manner and using Reactive streams with Server Side Events. Backend is developed using Sprint Boot. It exposes multiple end-points for both blocking and non-blocking calls to fetch the quotes from MongoDB using its reactive driver manager.
 

First, make sure the backend side is up and running, MongoDB included. If you cloned the git repository, youâ€™ll need to download the node dependencies. From the angular-reactive folder, you have to execute:

$ npm install

Then, we can run the frontend application from the command line with:

$ npm run ng serve

Navigate with the browser to http://localhost:4200
